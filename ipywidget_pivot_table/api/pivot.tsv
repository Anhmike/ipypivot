Key 	Type 	Default value 	Description
rows 	array of strings 	[] 	array of attribute names to use as rows
cols 	array of strings 	[] 	array of attribute names for use as columns
aggregator 	function 	$.pivotUtilities .aggregators["Count"]() 	constructor for an object which will aggregate results per cell (see documentation)
aggregatorName 	string 	"Count" 	Name of the aggregator, used for display purposes in some renderers
renderer 	function 	table() 	generates output from pivot data structure (see documentation)
rowOrder 	string 	"key_a_to_z" 	the order in which row data is provided to the renderer, must be one of "key_a_to_z", "value_a_to_z", "value_z_to_a", ordering by value orders by row total
colOrder 	string 	"key_a_to_z" 	the order in which column data is provided to the renderer, must be one of "key_a_to_z", "value_a_to_z", "value_z_to_a", ordering by value orders by column total
derivedAttributes 	object of functions 	{} 	object to define derived attributes (see documentation)
dataClass 	function 	$.pivotUtilities.PivotData 	Constructor for the data class to be built and passed to the Renderer (should be a subclass of the default)
filter 	function 	function(){return true;} 	called on each record, returns false if the record is to be excluded from the input before rendering or true otherwise
sorters 	object or function 	{} 	accessed or called with an attribute name and can return a function which can be used as an argument to array.sort for output purposes. If no function is returned, the default sorting mechanism is a built-in "natural sort" implementation. Useful for sorting attributes like month names, see example 1 and example 2.
rendererOptions 	object 	{} 	object passed through to renderer as options
localeStrings 	object 	en strings 	locale-specific strings for error messages (see locale parameter below)
